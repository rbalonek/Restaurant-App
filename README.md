## Restaurant-App

This app was built in four days as part of our General Assembly Unit 2 final project using React. 

## Features

I designed the app to be a prototype for a restaurant where the restaurant can create, edit, and delete menu items for an interactive guest experience.  I created this app not to replace the wait staff, but to augment their responsibilities in the era of Covid-19 and socially distanced service.  

I used Airtable for my Restful API calls. <br/>

After turning this project in, my computer and it's original files were destroyed so I am piecing back together the ReadMe, please email me if you have any questions about the project.
