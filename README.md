## Restaurant-App

This app was built in four days as part of our General Assembly Unit 2 final project using React. 

## Features

I designed the app to be a prototype for a restaurant where they could create, edit, and delete menu items for an interactive guest experience.  I did not create this to replace the wait staff but to augment their responsibilities in the era of Covid-19 and socially distanced service.
